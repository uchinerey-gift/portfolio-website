# 🌵 Chinerey “Chi Chi” Ukwu – Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website created for the Techtonica Software Engineering Program.  
It highlights my transition from healthcare operations into cybersecurity, IT support, and web development.  
The purpose of this project is to practice semantic HTML, CSS, accessibility, responsive layouts, and real-world portfolio structure.

## ♿ Accessibility (a11y)

This project includes accessibility best practices such as:

- `lang="en"` declared in the `<html>` tag  
- **Skip to main content** link for keyboard users  
- `aria-label` on navigation and social icons  
- `aria-labelledby` on major sections  
- `aria-required="true"` for required form fields  
- `aria-describedby` for form helper text  
- High-contrast text in the hero section  
- Alt text on the profile photo  
- Hover & focus states for interactive elements  
- Tested using **Lighthouse** and **axe DevTools**  

Accessibility was a major focus during development to ensure a better experience for screen readers and keyboard-only users.

- Build a dedicated Projects page with more portfolio pieces
